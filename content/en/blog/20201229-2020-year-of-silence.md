    A personal summary of the year 2020 on a musical level. A year marked by the pandemic that has devastated, among other things, the world of music
---

2020 is fading, but the mark left by this fateful year is indelible. About a year ago, we behold at the news coming out of China with a mixture of skepticism and concern. Who was going to tell us that a few months later, we would experience the same news in the first person. Who was going to tell us that 2020 will be the year we would spend in silence.

We are not going to talk now about all the lives that COVID has taken ahead, or the work that our health workers are doing, or the exhaustion that they carry, although sometimes media forgets to talk about it. Let's talk about silence.

If I look at any means of communication, if I listen to a politician, I get the feeling that this virus is killing in Spain, bars and restaurants, tourism and hundreds of lives. Everything in that order. It seems that bars, restaurants and nightclubs are the only ones affected by the different restrictions that they are putting to contain the virus and prevent infections. It seems that tourism and hospitality are the only two sectors that are suffering and that need to be saved (hence the closure of outdoor playgrounds before bars).The sector is dying ... like many other sectors.

This is a blog about music so I'm going to focus on talking about culture. Because it seems that we quickly forget that music is culture. As well as cinema and theater, two other forgotten sectors (the second more than the first, which tries to survive by dangerously reinventing itself, but that is not what I have come to talk about).

Since last March, concerts began to be postponed due to the state of alarm over the worrying advance that the virus was having on Europe and more specifically, on Spain. Groups like <important text="Tarja" />, <important text="Sons of Apollo" />, <important text="Overkill" /> or <important text="Lamb of God" /> along with <important text="Kreator" />, soon put the "postponed" sign at their concerts in our country. As the virus progressed and stayed in our lives, more groups were directly canceling their tours. The big (and also small) festivals were canceling or postponing their musical proposals until 2021, with all the millionaire losses that that entails. Other festivals, such as the <important text="Z! Live" />, they could be celebrated with impeccable security measures but with a great impact on the people who work in the sector.

To all of this must be added bands that have had to postpone the release of their albums or that have risked releasing them in the middle of a pandemic with irregular sales results. There are bands that have disappeared from the map because they have not been able to support the weight of a sector whose life was already hanging by a thread.

And we also have venues, many of them dying due to the cancellation of musical events. Some of them living on the edge and announcing small gigs, many times canceled, while wondering if this is going to be the last event they give before closing the doors forever.

Let's not forget that a concert is not just four or five people who get on stage for an hour to play their music. They are the costs of travel, accommodation, material rental. They are sound and light technicians, people who are in the merchandising area. They are the venues, or the stadiums. They are the people behind the bar, those who distribute drinks, wardrobes, cleaning, security. They are the record companies and the promoters. In the case of festivals, multiply it by a thousand, plus the income that they can leave in the city where it is held, directly or indirectly (and if not ask Viveiro).

In short, the world of music in particular and culture in general, is as wide and feeds as many mouths as having it in the background in emergency situations like this. And, under normal circumstances, it is a sector that is forgotten and mistreated by politicians and the media here in Spain.

This year, the music has remained silent. An ominous silence has become the soundtrack for 2020. COVID-19 has delivered a fatal blow to the music world. Let's hope that those who have the power and the possibility to take care of culture a little, have realized the very precarious state in which the sector is found and fix it in 2021. (<important text="SPOILER" />: This is not going to happen)

Here's to you all for a 2021 full of music and life!

Live Loud!
