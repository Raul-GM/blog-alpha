    Gig by Jinjer + The Agonist + Khroma + Space of Variations on December 11, 2019 at the Mon in Madrid
---

I could not end my year of shows in a better way than seeing Jinjer (4th time in 3 years) and above accompanied by my beloved The Agonist. An end to possibly my best year of concerts.

After many juggling schedules, public transport, and races, I was able to get at Mon a few minutes after the doors opened. It was surprising to see how on a Wednesday at 6:15 p.m., the place already had a large number of people. And this is what Jinjer has, which is capable of doing sold out (as in the rest of the concerts in Spain and as in 80% of his European tour) one day during the week having a few kilometers another super-gig that moves many people like Ghost along with Tribulation.

The Ukrainians, Space of Variations, started to warm up the atmosphere. I had listened to them weeks before to see what I was going to find, and the truth is that they didn't sound bad to me. Live was even better. Despite the sound and I'm not a big fan of using many effects on the singer and guitar mics, his staging was energetic and I pretty liked his live show. The singer (I have not managed to find out what his name is, sorry), did not stop moving around the small stage and cheering the audience. Public who knew how to respond in the same way.

Finnish Khroma were already different. Reviewing the setlist of the concert weeks before I could already feel that I did not like his proposal. Live was even worse. So many electronic elements that left the singer with his back to us while playing with them made the atmosphere in the Mon go down a lot. It was the time when many people took the opportunity to go to the bathroom, to order a beer or, like me, to the merchandising area (which, by the way, I have the feeling that prices have increased a lot lately. But that is another story) .

Finally Khroma finished and I waited with great emotion for the turn of The Agonist. I really wanted to see them. I couldn't go to his last visit to Madrid (also together with Jinjer) and I was very curious to see the Canadians live. His latest albums (<important text = "Eye of Providence" />, <important text = "Five" /> and the recent <important text = "Orphans" />) seem wonderful to me. And I wanted to see how Vicky responded live. The truth is that The Agonist totally exceeded my expectations.

The sound, although not was the best I have heard, was correct. The whole group was amazing. And Vicky ... Vicky showed that in addition to having a beautiful voice and perfectly mastering the changes from guttural to clean, she wastes pure sympathy and good vibes. She was always smiling and moving around the stage. She was transmitting very good vibes and that helped the public to enter into ecstasy. The pogos did not take long to form (in one of them, I don't know how, I went from sixth row to third).

As for the setlist, although it seemed very good to me, it was strange for me not to hear any song from his previous work, <important text = "Five" />, which for me has some great songs to present live. From the last album <important text = "In Vertigo" /> sounded (first song, with Vicky's sound very low, but it was a whiplash), <important text = "Gift of Silence" />, <important text = "Orphans "/> (to slow down a bit), <important text =" Burn It All Down "/> and <important text =" As One We Survive "/> (these last two to close their show. They sounded brutal. It looks like they are going to be fixed in their next setlists.) The Canadians demonstrated that they continue at a very high level and that despite the impediments they have had to launch their latest work, they are willing to give their all to demonstrate their high level.

There was only the main dish of the night left. The fashion group. The Ukrainians Jinjer. With Jinjer it was a love at first listen. When a friend recommended it to me about 3 years ago, I played the song <important text = "Sit, Stay, Roll Over" /> and I remember being shocked. My head exploded when I heard <important text = "I Speak Astronomy" /> and saw that who was behind those gutturals was an incredible woman and that her clean voice was as much or more incredible. Tatiana's is from another world. And it is accompanied by incredible musicians. Eugene is a virtuous bass, and it's amazing to hear him. Roman has a mastery of the guitar that is outstanding, and he makes it so easy... Vlad strikes the drums with power and perfection that blows your mind.

What I like about Jinjer's concerts is that they are direct. Almost without stops, with fair interaction with the public but without losing the connection with it. They catch you and do not let you go in more than an hour and a half as theme after theme falls. Without artifice. Pure music. Which demonstrates, by the way, Tatiana's physical form, which does not stop moving and singing in that time without losing a note.

In this case they came to present their latest album <important text = "Macro" /> and played their most representative songs; <important text = "Judgment (& Punishment)" />, <important text = "Retrospection" /> (which made my hair stand on end), <important text = "On the Top" /> and <important text = " Pit of Consciousness "/>. The latter chanted and danced by the crowd. They also played the entire EP of <important text = "Micro" /> (except the last one). I love <important text = "Teacher, Teacher!" />, is my favorite along with <important text = "Pisces" /> and <important text = "Words of Wisdom" />. From <important text = "Cloud Factory" /> could not fall other than <important text = "Who is Gonna Be the One" />, which made us crazy. From <important text = "King of Everything" /> the classics <important text = "Sit Stay Roll Over" />, <important text = "I Speak Astronomy" />, <important text = "Just Another" />, <important text = "Words of Wisdom" />, <important text = "Pisces" /> and ... to the final surprise, I hadn't seen them play it at other shows of the tour, they played <important text = "Captain Clock "/>. So they closed a great night.

JJinjer has made a place for himself among the greats in recent years through talent, a lot of work and humility. They deserve to be where they are and in a few years I am sure they will be even higher

If you were left wanting more Jinjer, these days they have confirmed their participation in festivals in 2020 such as the Legends of Rock in Villena and RockFest in Barcelona and Rock the Night in Madrid
