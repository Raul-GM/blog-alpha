    five bands that are standing out in the field of Spanish rock and heavy. Look out! There is a bonus track!
---

If you are a Spanish rock and metal lover, I'm sure you know the most notorious bands of this industry. The well known <important text="Warcry" />, <important text="Saratoga" />, <important text="Stravaganzza" />, <important text="Sober" /> or <important text="Angelus Apatrida" /> are a small sample of how to make good music in my country.

Even so, there are a lot of bands with different backgrounds that, little by little, with a huge effort and work, are earning the right to be in the first line of fire. I'm going to show you five bands that I've meet recently and I'm still shocked by their quality and proposal. At the end of this post, you're gonna see a bonus track that I hope you like it. Let's shall begin:

<h2>Bloodhunter</h2>

/>

The band based in galician fields is one of the biggest referents in extreme metal in Spain. Born in 2008, they release their first LP in 2014 where you can appreciate their quality and stands out the impressive voice of <important text="Diva Satánica" />, with a powerful growls that give more force to their songs. They have played in many festivals like <important text="Resurrection Fest" /> and <important text="Leyendas del Rock" />. <important text="Diva Satánica" /> was also invited by <important text="Kamelot" /> to sing a song with them in <important text="Z-Live" /> festival in 2019. The galician singer is, since this year, vocalist of the brazilian band <important text="Nervosa" />. Nowadays, Bloodhunter is recording their third album, althogh they have re-released a few months ago their first album, with a new artwork and some live songs.

<h2>Bárbara Black</h2>

Barbara Black begin her solo career in 2016 after several years working very hard in the world of music. She has recently released his second LP called <important text="Love, Death & Flies" />. In it, she experiments with a harder sound than her predecesor but withot lose his american southern country-rock flavor. It worth to listen this album. It's a delicious work full of good taste, passion and soul.

<h2>Celtian</h2>

/>

The band, founded by <important text="Diego Palacio" />, as we can guess from its name, plays a folk-metal that perfectly mixes typical instruments of celtic music with the power and speed of the metal guitar, bass and drums. All of this accompanied by a delicated orchestration and the sweet voice of <important text="Xana Lavey" /> creating a magical atmosphere. Their second album, <important text="En tierra de hadas" />, counts on the colaboration of well known musicians like <important text="Patricia Tapia" />, <important text="Celtas Cortos" /> or even the international <important text="Michalina Malisz" /> of <important text="Eluveitie" /> and her hurdy-gurdy.

<h2>Death & Legacy</h2>

The band from Zamora of melodic metal was already doing a great work with their two first albums when, unexpectedly, ran into with the  singer <important text="Hynphernia" />. Her growls and voice tone make the sound heavier and extremer. This new sound can be appreciate in her recent third album called <important text="INF3RNO" />. We can find with a very aggresive sound mixed with a melodic base during eight dangerously catchy tracks.

<h2>Megara</h2>

I still remember, in 2018, waiting in the queue to see <important text="Halestorm" /> when some people came to distribute some flyers of their bands. One of them was the singer of <important text="Screams on sunday" /> (I'll talk about them another day because they play an awesome music). The others were a group of guys dressed with strange clothes, accompanied by a guy disguised of a suited white rabbit with a baseball bat. I didn't know them but since this day I can't stop hearing about them. <important text="Megara" />'s music has a very personal style and an incredible staging and marketing. Their singer <important text="Kenzy" /> is a trully hurricane on stage. They are hard-workers and they are where they are on their own merits

<h2>BONUS TRACK:</h2>

<h2>Dark Moor</h2>

/>

Alright! I admit it! This bonus track is a trap! Who doesn't still know who are <important text="Dark Moor" />? But there isn't a group that I love more than this. Led by <important text="Enrik García" />, the have been more than 20 years active. With 11 albums is one of the most creative bands of our country. Each album is different and equal at the same time than previous one. They are the same in their roots but different in their sound. They are not afraid to bet with different and new sounds. In their origins, their sound could be near to power metal. But in their trajectory you could see sounds like classical rock, symphonic metal, classical music, folk music and so on. In my humble opinion, they have one of he best voices (<important text="Alfred Romero" />) and guitars (<important text="Enrik García" />) of the spanish rock and metal.

A band that, ironically, has triumphed more internationally than in Spain. They have played in Italy, France, Mexico, Russia and even in China (becoming the first spanish metal band in do it). Their albums have been an amazing reception in countries like USA and Japan. They appeared in the <important text="BURRN!" /> magazine as one of the bests singer, bassist, band and album in 2013.

For this reason <important text="Dark Moor" /> has a little space in this post. Let's give  LOVE to <important text="Dark Moor" />, please!
