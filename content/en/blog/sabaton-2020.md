    Sabaton + Apocalyptica + Amaranthe gig at February 5, 2020 at the Palacio de Vistalegre in Madrid
---

Date marked on the calendar for many months. Wednesday, February 5, 2020. Vistalegre Palace. Seven p.m. I had requested the day of vacation at work to attend this long-awaited appointment. 3 fears hung over my head; one associated with each group. I arrive about 3 and a half hours before the doors open and there are already almost 100 people waiting. This is insane.

Sabaton came back to Madrid to present his new album, <important text = "The Great War" />, with Apocalyptica and Amaranthe. People could think that it was an atypical gig because of the three bands' styles were so different. The afternoon would be epic. As I was saying, it was Wednesday, laboral day, and many people crowded into the Vistalegre Palace several hours before the doors opened.

After waiting outside and inside the venue, the Amarathe show began. My fear was that I had already seen Amaranthe last year and my opinion coincided with what I had read in several bogs: the Swedish show was quite cold. I wanted to give them a second chance because the day I saw them I was pretty tired. The fear vanished immediately because the band remained very active and very communicative with the public (which was already close to 3/4 of the capacity). Elize Ryd is a show and she doesn't stop for a second on stage. Her voice is wonderful (I honestly think that in Amaranthe she is not exploited as much as she could). Henrik was brutal with his gutturals and I liked Nils a lot with his clean voice and with his leading role on several times.

They started with <important text = "Maximize" /> and the party didn't stop for a moment until the quiet <important text = "Amaranthine" />, which lit the hearts and lanterns and lighters of the Vistalegre Palace. The party returned with the brutal <important text = "GG6" />, with which Henrik showed off with his gutturals. The 40 minutes flew by and when we were having the best time (by now, even those who did not know this group and were suspicious of its musical proposal, were bouncing and giving everything on the floor), <important text="Drop Dead Cynical" /> announced the end of the show. Very funny the Swedish show. I look forward to seeing what your proposal is as headliner at the concert that they will offer in Madrid at the end of the year together with Beyond The Black.

After a wait that seemed a bit long, with a background in which different images were going to be projected, the Apocalyptica concert began. The second fear of the night was to see what the Finns offered, because their style, which I love and I think is fantastic that this last album they came to present, <important text = "Cell-0" />, returned to the origins of a purely instrumental album, it seemed to me a risky proposal to be between Amaranthe and Sabaton. But it was the first time that I saw them and I was willing to let go.

The beginning was thunderous. Mikko Sirén hitted the drums hard in the opening chords of <important text = "Ashes Of The Modern World" />. The sound of the cellos started a bit chaotic, in my opinion, but it was finally straightened with <important text = "Path" />, another marvel.

The first break after <important text = "In Route to Mayhem" />, came with Elyze Ryd entering the stage. This time, to give a masterful voice to Rammstein's famous <important text = "Seeman" />. That moment was one of those that will stay in my heart for life. It was incredible. Elyze endured one more song to give us an <important text = "I Don't Care" /> that was chanted by the crowd.

The second part of their concert began, where they played their versions of <important text = "Thunderstruck" />, <important text = "Seek & Destroy" />, <important text = "Nothing Else Matters" /> (where the audience we put the voice and lyrics) ending the frantic <important text = "Hail Of The Mountain King" />. Apocalyptica left me a very pleasant taste in my mouth and they can count on me on the date scheduled for the last quarter of the year in which they will visit our country with Epica on another night that will seem unforgettable.

The most awaited moment of the late night arrived. My legs were barely supporting me while a large curtain in which you could read "Sabaton - The Great War" covered the entire stage. It was the moment of my third fear of the night. I've been following Sabaton for many, many years. In all the concerts they have given in Madrid they always tell the same anecdote, and it is all they have achieved since they played in a small Madrid venue with a few dozen people. I was in that room, I was one of the few people who saw them in that live show and I was captivated by their strength, their closeness and their humility. And my fear was precisely that they had lost those values now that they filled stadiums and had become worthy heirs of the greatest. Fear dissipated as soon as the curtain fell and the thunderous <important text = "Ghost Division" /> sounded, with Sabaton giving it his all in the trenches of the stage, the battery set in the tank, fires and a Joakim singing with it strength and tone as it did some 15 years ago.

With <important text = "The Great War" /> the party didn't stop until the arrival of <important text = "The Attack Of The Dead Men" />, where our frontman came out wearing a gas mask (I can't comprehend how he could sing that way). <important text = "Seven Pillars Of Wisdom" /> and <important text = "Lost Batallion" /> passed over us until we reached the first break. Joakim started playing with a red painted organ as if it were the famous Red Baron plane and then played the epic <important text = "The Red Baron" />. They were followed by <important text = "The Last Stand" />, <important text = "82nd All The Way" /> (where many people thought that Elyze Ryd would make the triplet singing it with Joakim) and <important text = "Night Witches "/>, a song that personally drives me crazy, and what sounded better than ever.

It was time for Apocalyptica cellos to take the stage and perform alongside the Swedes <important text = "Angels Calling" />, <important text = "The Price of a Mile" />, <important text = "The Lion From The North "/> and <important text =" Carolus Rex "/>. I think the mix of these two groups sounds great. The quality of the Swedes with their catchy music and the epicity provided by the cellos led by Eicca Toppinen should come together again.

They all left the stage to start the final attack. <important text = "Primo Victoria" /> sounded like always and made us bounce more than ever. This is the band's flagship song (along with <important text = "Attero Dominatus" />, which has sadly disappeared from setlists in recent years). The next one to play was <important text = "Bismarck" />, which particularly on the first few listeners didn't excite me too much and over time, it has become one of my favorites of the group. The last explosions and flares introduced <important text = "To Hell And Back" /> to end a shower of pamphlets on which they had drawn, with a design of the posters of the First World War, with the motives of the main songs of the group. A great detail for a brutal concert, a sound of 10, an impressive staging with three sensational groups that have put all the meat on the grill to make us live an unforgettable night.
