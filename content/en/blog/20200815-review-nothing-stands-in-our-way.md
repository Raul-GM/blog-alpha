    Review of the book that Lacuna Coil released for its 20th anniversary in 2019.
---

It's not easy to turn 20 years in the music industry, much less do it with a career like that of the Italians Lacuna Coil. To celebrate those twenty years on stage, they gave us the only live show at the O2 in London that we can enjoy on DVD and Bluray and a book that talks about his entire career, which is what we are going to talk about now.

A few years after getting into the world of metal, I came across a group that caught my attention a lot called Lacuna Coil. They were Italians and at that time I was fascinated with the also Italians, Rhapsody. I was young and inexperienced and perhaps thinking I expected found a similar sound like Luca Turilli and Fabio Lione band, after a couple of listens to a handful of songs I decided to put them in the "meh" drawer.

As time went by, and as I was gaining ear and maturity, I found myself with <important text = "Maki, Cri, Andrea" /> and company in the most surreal way. Through the Guitar Hero video game. I had to play a song with some initial chords that got into my head and trapped me for several days (and years until today). That song was <important text = "Closer" />, from <important text = "Karmacode" />. I liked them so much that I decided to give them another chance and since then they have been one of my favorite bands to date.

That is why I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get his first book. <important text = "Nothing Stands In Our Way" /> reviews her entire musical career. From the childhood of its founders and current members, <important text = "Marco Coti Zelati" Maki ", Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro" />, to the mythical concert <important text = "The 119 Show - Live in London" /> they gave for their twentieth anniversary. Also involve former members of the group such as Cristiano "Pizza" Migliore or Cristiano "CriZ" Mozzati and his current representative Valerie Lynch

In the book, each of the original members talk about their beginnings. How was their family, their environment, their musical references and finally how they met and began to create <important text = "Sleep Of Right" /> and <important text = "Ethereal" />,  the seed of <important text = "Lacuna Coil" />. I found it very interesting to know how they grew up and how they were their first steps in the world of music to better understand what they are now.

The rest of the chapters of the book are dedicated specifically to each of his albums. I think remarkable the chapter of their first album, <important text = "In A Reverie" />, that show us how a young group with inexperience, enthusiasm and a lot of talent gets into the music industry.

The book also has comments from some of its producers (<important text = "Waldemar Sorychta" /> and <important text = "Don Gilmore" />), which it's very interesting in order tounderstand how a group works and what is the mission of its producer. Also, it helps to better understand each of the discs. The difference between <important text = "Shallow Life" /> and <important text = "Dark Adrenaline" /> has always seemed curious to me, two albums that seem very different to me and thanks to <important text = " Nothing Stands In Our Way "/> I have come to understand better.

<important text = "Nothing Stands In Our Way" /> is full of studio photos and photos of his video clips or concerts and curious and never-before-published photos that will make us smile. In addition, there are different sketches created by Maki for song concepts and designs of the different costumes that the group has worn in its different stages.

In summary. This book is not just for fans, but for any music lover who wants to know how a group works on the inside and how it relates to the complicated music industry. It is a book told with sincerity and humility, which are two of the greatest qualities of Cri, Maki and Andrea.
