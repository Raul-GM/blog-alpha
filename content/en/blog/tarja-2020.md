    Concert of Tarja in the "In The Raw" tour in Madrid on March 9, 2020. The supported bands were, Temperance and Serpentyne
---

I had too many years waiting this momeny. It was going to be the first time I saw Tarja on stage and enjoy her talented voice, live. It was a date, wich was inexplicaly postponed until March 9. I will try to write this post with respect and admiration for all the musicians that were on the stage that wonderful night and, above all, no comment on the ex-relationship between Tarja and Nightwish.

Tarja's show already started waiting to enter. Many groups of people of different ages chatted about the Finnish singer. The most repeated word was <important text="DIVA" />

Once inside and settled in a good position, the mini concert of the English <important text="Serpentyne" /> began. Nada conocía de ellos más que cinco canciones que había escuchado esa mañana. They play folk metal with a soprano singer who, in particular, didn't say anything to me. The concert was strange because the band seemed totally out of place. Especially the singer, who did everything she could to raise an audience that was still cold and missed by the show. The sound was not good and some lights that constantly blinded a group of people (particularly caused me to move away from my position to settle on one of the sides of the But due to the headache and eyes that I was starting to have). The positive part of that concert was the piper, a Scotsman who wore a skirt and played the bagpipes as if he were possessed by some Celtic god.

After a time of waiting, the <important text="Temperance" /> party began. <important text="Temperance" /> is an italian band that play a symphonic metal with the great voices of their three singers. They started with a powerful Mission Impossible, from their latest album <important text="Viridian" /> (which by the way, I grabbed his vinyl limited green edition from the merchandising stand). From the first minute of this song, they showed us that they had come to Madrid to have a good time making quality metal, powerful songs and a waste of sympathy with the sole objective of spreading that enthusiasm. Despite the fact that once again the sound was pretty bad, the audience came up and bounced as if they were looking at the headliners.

Temperance played mostly songs from his latest album. Once again, the sound did not let us enjoy songs like the fabulous <important text="My Demons Can't Sleep" />, <important text="Start Another Round" /> or <important text="Of Jupiter and Moons" /> as it should. The time flew by and of course, I hope Temperance could come back to Madrid as headliners with enough time to demonstrate their quality with a decent sound.

We were waiting for Tarja when the latest news of coronavirus made us to think that, probably, this could be our last concert for a long time.

The start of the concert was spectacular. Tarja and the rest of the musicians opened with <important text="My Serene" />, the theme of their latest album, <important text="In The Raw" />, followed by <important text="My Demons In You" />, in which personally, I didn't miss the growls of Alissa. These first songs made me confirm what I already assumed. Tarja was truly a diva. She is a woman who fills the stage when she enters it. His elegance when walking, when moving, when singing, grabs you instantly and doesn't release you until he leaves it. Tarja always grabs your attention. The Finnish singer was very communicative with the public speaking mostly in a very correct Spanish.

Little by little, the songs, faster or slower, were being played. I can highlight songs like <important text="Goodbye Stranger" /> (here I missed Cristina Scabbia, but this is something personal for me) and <important text="Falling Awake" />. Here I have to talk about the great artists who accompany Tarja on stage. Even though they were in the background, they also shone with their talent and attitude. I especially liked his bassist and cellist, who gave the songs a very special touch.

Thus we come to one of the moments of the night. The interpretation of my beloved <important text = "Planet Hell" /> by Nightwish. I almost dropped a tear because it's one of my favorite songs of the group. Then, we come to the most magical moment of the night. Tarja took the stage with her piano and performed the theme of her latest album, <important text="You and I" />.

We were reaching the final part of the gig. With a dedicated audience and a magic environment that only a diva of her position can reach. This is because of the talent, the voice and the presence of Tarja joined with the quality of the musicians of the band. Is for this reason that I think that Tarja never walk alone.
