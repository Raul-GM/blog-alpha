    Eluveitie + Lacuna Coil + Infected Rain on November 28, 2019 in the Black Box of the Palacio Vistalegre in Madrid
---

Thursday, November 28 was an appointment marked on my calendar for many months. Since I saw my Italians 3 years ago, I made a promise not to miss Lacuna Coil when they passed through Madrid. And they were accompanied by the Moldavians, Infected Rain (I was curious to see Lena Scissorhands live) and the Swiss Eluveitie as headliners.

There was a lot of expectation, that despite being a daily day, that the doors were opening soon and that it was a fairly cold day, people began to gather at the gates of the Palacio Vistalegre very early. And it was evident that there was a great desire to see Cristina Scabbia and company and, even more, Eluveitie.

The Moldavians were in charge of making us warm up and I think that, despite the problems they had, some lights that blinded the group and a bad sound in the first songs, managed to get us on our feet. The whole group was dedicated and putting a lot of passion in it so that the public had a good time. Vidick was dancing, jumping and wagging his dreadlocks throughout his concert. Sergey, the other guitar, and Vladimir, the bass, were constantly interacting with the audience and throwing picks as if there was no tomorrow. Eugen Voluta was pounding the drums relentlessly. All this while Lena was pulling guttural and clean song after song. Encouraging the public constantly. They were so dedicated in their performance that in the last song, Lena came down from the stage, perched on the fence that separated the stage from the crowd and tore her soul to give us one last song that will enter the history of the great songs I've heard live. She ended with tears in her eyes, the crowd, maddened and I with goosebumps. Lena said at the beginning of the concert that it was her first time in Madrid. I hope with all my heart that it wasn't the last time.

Lacuna Coil returned to the capital three years later to present us live the songs from their new album, <important text = "Black Anima" />. Album that has been very well received in our country, ranking 22nd among the best-selling records. 
LThe Italians were splendid at all times, they were seen enjoying themselves on stage, with a very active Andrea Ferro (who has improved a lot at the vocal level in recent years), although with some sound problems (sometimes he was not heard). practically nothing) and a Cristina Scabbia that, what can I say about her. I have not seen a live voice like Cri's. Powerful, clean, vibrant ... It's a delight to hear. The rest of the band, "Maki" (bass), Diego Cavallotti (guitar) and Richard Meiz (drums) were impeccable, leaving the whole show to Cristina and Andrea who were thanking us at all times that we chose to be there with them that night.

Special mention also to the new songs live. They are amazing. <important text = "Sword of Anger" /> sounded great, <important text = "Layers of Time" /> blew my mind especially in the Cristina parts, showing once again her wonderful voice. <important text = "Reckless" /> lifted the audience and with <important text = "Veneficium" /> I got goose bumps. Every time will be more difficult to leave out songs off their setlist.

I don't know if it's because of the high expectations or because they didn't come as the headliner, but the concert was short and maybe a little colder than the one 3 years ago. When I realized it, <important text = "Enjoy the Silence" /> was already playing, a song that they usually play from the middle to the end of their show. Also, compared to other stops on his tour, about 3 songs were left off the set list (I would have liked to hear <important text = "Naughty Christmas" /> live). I need more Lacuna Coil through my veins, and it looks like we'll have more in 2020 ...

The Italians left the stage and hung a curtain to hide everything that was being prepared for Eluveitie. I really wanted to see them, because I had heard many benefits about their live shows, with all their instrumental display and their festive folk-metal.

After a short wait, Fabienne Erni (vocals and harp), Nicole Ansperger (violin) and Michalina Malisz (hurdy-gurdy) appeared, dressed in white robes with hoods, while they sang the <important text = "Verja Urit An Bitus" />, Fabienne played a kind of high trumpet finished in a head of animal. Moment in which they left the stage to drop the curtain and discover the rest of the group, starting with the song that gives its name to their latest album <important text = "Ategnatos" />.

The truth is that it is impressive to see 9 musicians with so much talent on stage playing harmoniously and perfectly playing the various instruments that were presented to us. And is that apart from the violin, harp and hurdy-gurdy previously described, we were able to enjoy the flute and bagpipes (at the hands of Matteo Sisti), the mandolin and a varied set of flutes (by vocalist Chrigel Glanzmann) and the classics bass, guitars and drums (by Kay Brem, Rafael Salzmann, Jonas Wolf and Alain Ackermann).

Focusing especially on his latest work, a large number of songs fell that delighted the public. I would like to highlight <important text = "Epona" /> and <important text = "A Rose for Epona" />, with a huge Fabienne. <important text = "Deathwalker" /> and <important text = "Ambiramus" />, which for me are the best songs by Ategnatos and the now classic <important text = "Helvetios" /> that caused the maximum madness.

Thursday night was a great party with three quite different groups with a common purpose, to make us have a great time. More nights like this, please!
